## Building for Production

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Customization

### Theming

The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You can customize the theme by modifying the `tailwind.config.js` file.

### Mock Data

During development, the application uses mock data located in `src/data/mockData.ts`. In a production environment, you would replace this with API calls to your backend services.

## Future Enhancements

- Authentication system
- Dark mode support
- Mobile application
- Bill payment functionality
- Investment portfolio tracking
- Financial advice and recommendations
- Expense categorization using AI
- Export financial data to CSV/PDF
